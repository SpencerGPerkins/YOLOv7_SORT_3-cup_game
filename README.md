# YOLOv7/SORT for cup/ball detection and tracking
This is a repository of the vision sub-system used for a demonstration utilizing natural language and GAI to command a robotic arm
The scenario for the demonstration was based on the 3-cup monte game, so YOLOv7 and SORT were used for tracking the ball and target cup.

In addition, the repo contains a vip module which handles the limitations of SORT within the specific dynamics of a 3-cup monte scenario.
